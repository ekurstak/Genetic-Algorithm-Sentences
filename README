Genetic Algorithm - Sentence Evolution

This is just a quick example of how a genetic algorithm works.
This will take a target sentence and try to evolve a population of random strings to that final form.
I did not go for optimization, but rather demonstration.

Example usage:

sentence.py <number of members> '<target sentence here>'

sentence.py 100 'Hello world'
Goal: Hello world
Done! Took: 368 generations!

sentence.py 100 'This is just a longer example that should take many generations to finish.'
Goal: This is just a longer example that should take many generations to finish.
Done! Took: 9272 generations!

sentence.py 1000000 'hello'
Goal: hello
Done! Took: 34 generations!

You can and should play with different values for how often members mutate, what percentage die off, what percentage of parents mates, and how big the population is.
